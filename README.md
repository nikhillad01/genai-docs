# GenAI Docs

This repository contains my personal documentation and notes on Generative AI.

Built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) — a static site generator that's perfect for project documentation.

## 📚 What's Inside

- Concepts and components of GenAI  
- LangChain, LLMs, and prompt engineering  
- Tools, libraries, and best practices  

## 🚀 Getting Started

To view the docs locally:

```bash
# Install MkDocs
pip install mkdocs

# Serve the documentation locally
mkdocs serve
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser.

## 📦 Build Static Site

To build the documentation as a static site:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

The output will be in the `site/` directory.

## 📁 Structure

- `docs/` – Markdown source files  
- `mkdocs.yml` – MkDocs configuration file  

## 🌐 Deploy

Live site [GitHub Pages](https://nikhillad01.github.io/genai-docs/).
